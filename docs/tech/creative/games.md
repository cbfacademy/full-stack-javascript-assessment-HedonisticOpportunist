# üêà‚Äç‚¨õ SPACE CATS - GAMES

Due to time constraints, _**Space Cats**_ only displays two games that build upon each other.

As with the interactive art, these games aim to demonstrate how effective _p5.js_ is [1].

## CATCH BUBBLES GAME

The following scene follows a cat [2] directed by keyboard arrow movements [3] against a star-filled background [4] with the goal of 'catching' bubbles [5].

The bubbles' colour and size change upon scene reload. The cat is kept within the bounds of the canvas [8] [9].

Catching bubbles increments the score by one, and the game resets once the score reaches ten.

## SPACE BUBBLES SHOOTER GAME

The scene builds upon the game above, but -- instead of a cat -- the player is a spaceship [6].

The spaceship fires bullets [7] and gains points if a bubble has been hit [5].

Similarly to the previous game, the player stays within the boundaries of the canvas by constraining its coordinates [10].
