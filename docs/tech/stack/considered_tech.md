# 🐈‍⬛ SPACE CATS - TOOLS THAT WERE CONSIDERED

These libraries will be revisited for later purposes, though ❥.

## THREE.JS

_Three.js_ – a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) to create and display animated 3D computer graphics [1]- proved more challenging to set up than _p5.js_ [2].

As the purpose of _Space Cats_ is simplicity, _Three.js_ proved unsuitable.

## @P5-WRAPPER-REACT

Although interesting, _@P5-wrapper/react_ [3] requires considerable React knowledge, and the project time frame needed to be more significant to accommodate that.

## REACT-THREE-FIBER

Similarly to _Three.js_ [1], _react-three_fiber_ [4] comes with a steep learning curve that would have posed a risk to the project's development.

## REDUX

_Redux_ [5] is an intricate and daunting library that, while not fully incorporated within the project, inspired the creation of a _constants_ and _services_ directory within the _frontend_ package.

## NETLIFY

_Netlify_ [6] seemed like a natural choice for hosting the front end; however, creating an account proved annoying due to suspension after sign-up and needing an identity verification to reactivate it.
