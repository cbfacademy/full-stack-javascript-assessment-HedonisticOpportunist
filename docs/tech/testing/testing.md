_**Space Cats**_ contains integration, unit, component and end-to-end frontend tests.

# 🐈‍⬛ SPACE CATS - MANUAL TESTING

A significant portion of testing for this project was carried out manually, using tools such as _Chrome Dev Tools_ [1].

Manual testing was helpful for ad-hoc verification and understanding how the codebase worked.

# 🐈‍⬛ SPACE CATS - BACKEND TESTING

The main (integration) test is _app.test_js_ file, which utilises _Jest_ [2] and _supertest_ [3].

_**Space Cats**_ also has unit tests which use _Jest_ [2] and _mocking_ [4]

# 🐈‍⬛ SPACE CATS - FRONTEND TESTING

The front end uses _cypress_ for component and end-to-end testing [5].
